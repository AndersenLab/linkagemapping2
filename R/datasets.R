#' Cross object for N2xCB4856 RIAILs
#'
#' In this object, N2 genotypes are encoded as 1 and CB4856 genotypes are
#' encoded as 2. This cross object contains no heterozyous loci. When the
#' extract genotype function is run on this cross object, N2 genotypes are
#' converted to -1 and CB4856 genotypes to 1. For mappings with this cross
#' object, negative effect sizes indicate that N2 had the greater phenotype
#' value while postive effect sizes indicate that CB4856 had a greater phenotype
#' value.

#' Any position with a breakpoint in any of the RIAIL sets (set 1 = QX1-239,

#' N2 genotypes are encoded as 1 and CB4856 genotypes are encoded as 2. This

#' Cross object for N2xLSJ2 RIAILs
#'
#' In this object, N2 genotypes are encoded as 1 and LSJ2 genotypes are
#' encoded as 3. This cross object had heterozyous loci removed (set to NA). If
#' heterozygous loci are introduced back into the data, they should be encoded
#' as 2. When the extract genotype function is run on this cross object, N2
#' genotypes are converted to -1 and LSJ2 genotypes to 1. If heterozygous loci
#' are introduced back into the data, they will be extracted as the value 0. For
#' mappings with this cross object, negative effect sizes indicate that N2 had
#' the greater phenotype value while postive effect sizes indicate that LSJ2 had
#' a greater phenotype value.
